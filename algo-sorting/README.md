# Merge Sort / Bubble Sort / Radix Sort
- Write three different sorting algorithms that return an array that is sorted from smallest to largest integer.
 ## All Functions
 - When you input:
    - [20, 40, 5, 9]
    - Returns:
        - [5, 9, 20, 40]
 - All of the algorithms are different, but the result is the same.
